When I look at the JPG file I thought it may relate to steg or soemthing as usual I was trying to check couple of things about the file

-  File header   :heavy_check_mark:
-  File type   :heavy_check_mark:
-  Checks for Stego   :heavy_check_mark: 
   * No sucess with various stego tools

After having little brain strom with the file attached to challenge, got something in my mind that the challenge name starts with Listen but here we have .jpg.

Did something hidden inside the image  :question: 

Lets see what inside the JPG with Strings, HexDump or HexEditor (010Editor).
